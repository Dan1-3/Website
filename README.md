# Website
Design Detailed Document-Website

First of all, the main purpose of this project is to acquire the basic knowledge about how to create a website using HTML and CSS. In addition, another objective is to know different methods to give up information. For example, using tables, menus, lists ...

The requirements about the website were very clear. We needed to store all the images in a single image folder, another css folder with the main and unique css file, the index.html, which is the main page. Finally, a public folder to store the different html pages: about, topic, net, the degree, with fundamentals file inside, and the contact page.

The Visual design I have used contains a background image with the information stored in different paragraphs. Also I’ve added a hover in the navigation menu, as well as some forms included in the contact page, to add some visual effects and interactive pages, as so to try different options to store and demand information.

This is a brief text about how I created the project:
First of all, I read all the theory and the requirements needed to understand quite well the purpose and the methodology of the project. Furthermore, I started creating all the files and folders required so the basic structure was already done. Once I finished this first part, I started adding the content to each of the html files, with their respective css aspects. One of the things I tried to add was a swiper in the index, after searching how to do it on the internet, so I could learn how to do it.

Now I would like to explain the main problems I had during the creation of the website:

The main problem was the first few days, though I didn't have much knowledge abouts HTML websites, so I couldn't do much complicated things. However, a few days later, when I already knew the basic commands and structures, the work was much easier, though I could do things a little bit more complex.

Another problem I had to face with was to store all the style attributes in the same css file, though I first made several css files and moving all of them to the same one was quite difficult, particularly when changing the names and adding classes or id’s to each specific text or background. 

In conclusion, I truly believe this project has helped me a lot in order to learn and acquire knowledge about the creation and development of websites. Furthermore, overcoming the problems that appeared was a great method to learn even more.
